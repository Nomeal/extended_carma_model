# extended_carma_model

This R code is part of the software project in the Master's program Mathematical Analysis and Modelling (MAM) at the University of Augsburg.

With the help of these R functions one can simulate and plot a variation of a CARMA model which is extended by an additive factor. Simulations are based on the Euler-Maruyama scheme.
